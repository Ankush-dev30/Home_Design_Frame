# Home_Design_Frame
I developed my first front-end template using only HTML and CSS, which allowed me to practice and showcase my skills in creating clean, well-structured layouts and visually appealing designs. This project helped me gain a solid understanding of HTML semantic elements, page structure, and CSS styling techniques, including typography, colors, spacing, flexbox, and grid layouts. I focused on making the design fully responsive, ensuring it looks and works well on different screen sizes and devices. Additionally, this project taught me how to organize code efficiently for readability and maintainability. Completing this template was an important milestone in my journey as a front-end developer and motivated me to continue improving my HTML and CSS skills for more advanced web design projects.
